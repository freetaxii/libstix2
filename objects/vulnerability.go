VulnerabilityType - This type implements the STIX 2 Vulnerability SDO and defines
all of the properties methods needed to create and work with the STIX Vulnerability
SDO. All of the methods not defined local to this type are inherited from
the individual properties.

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2 specificaton documents.

A Vulnerability is "a mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker
to gain access to a system or network" [CVE]. For example, if a piece of malware
exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a Vulnerability
object that references CVE-2015-12345.

The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of
vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an
external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability
objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and exploited as part of
malicious cyber activity. As such, Vulnerability objects can be used as a
linkage to the asset management and compliance process.
