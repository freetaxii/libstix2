/*
TAXIIError - This type implements the TAXII 2 Error Message and defines
all of the properties and methods needed to create and work with the TAXII Error
Message. All of the methods not defined local to this type are inherited from
the individual properties.

The following information comes directly from the TAXII 2 specification documents.

TAXII primarily relies on the standard HTTP error semantics (400-series and
500-series status codes, defined by sections 6.5 and 6.6 of [RFC7231]) to allow
TAXII Servers to indicate when an error has occurred. For example, an HTTP 404
(Not Found) status code in response to a request to get information about a
Collection means that the Collection could not be found. The tables defining the
Endpoints in sections 4 and 5 identify common errors and which response should
be used, but are not exhaustive and do not describe all possible errors.

In addition to this, TAXII defines an error message structure that is provided
in the response body when an error status is being returned. It does not,
however, define any error codes or error conditions beyond those defined by HTTP.

The error message is provided by TAXII Servers in the response body when
returning an HTTP error status and contains more information describing the
error, including a human-readable title and description, an error_code and
error_id, and a details structure to capture further structured information
about the error. All of the fields are application-specific and clients
shouldn't assume consistent meaning across TAXII Servers even if the codes, IDs,
or titles are the same.

SetExternalDetails - This method takes in a string value representing a URL
