Collections - This type implements the TAXII 2 Collections Resource and defines
all of the properties and methods needed to create and work with the TAXII Collections
Resource. All of the methods not defined local to this type are inherited from
the individual properties.

The following information comes directly from the TAXII 2 specification documents.

This Endpoint provides information about the Collections hosted under this API
Root. This is similar to the response to get a Collection (see section 5.2), but
rather than providing information about one Collection it provides information
about all of the Collections. Most importantly, it provides the Collection's id,
which is used to request objects or manifest entries from the Collection.

The collections resource is a simple wrapper around a list of collection
resources.

/*
Collection - This type implements the TAXII 2 Collection Resource and defines
all of the properties and methods needed to create and work with the TAXII
Collection Resource. All of the methods not defined local to this type are
inherited from the individual properties.

DatastoreID = A unique integer that represents this collection
DateAdded   = The date that this collection was added to the system
Enabled     = Is this collection currently enabled
Hidden      = Is this collection currently hidden for the directory listing
Size        = The current size of the collection
ID 		    = The collection ID, a UUIDv4 value
Title 	    = The title of this collection
Description = A long description about this collection
CanRead     = A boolean flag that indicates if one can read from this collection
CanWrite    = A boolean flag that indicates if one can write to this collection
MediaTypes  = A slice of strings of the media types that are found in this collection

The following information comes directly from the TAXII 2 specification documents.

This Endpoint provides general information about a Collection, which can be used
to help users and clients decide whether and how they want to interact with it.
For example, it will tell clients what it's called and what permissions they
have to it.

The collection resource contains general information about a Collection, such as
its id, a human-readable title and description, an optional list of supported
media_types (representing the media type of objects can be requested from or
added to it), and whether the TAXII Client, as authenticated, can get objects
from the Collection and/or add objects to it.

CollectionQueryResult - This struct contains the various bits of meta data
that are returned from a query against a collection on a TAXII server. This is
done so that the method signatures do not need to change as time goes on and we
add more meta data that needs to be returned. It is important to note that a
collection may have more entries than the server or client wants to transmit. So
it is important to keep track of which records are actually being delivered to
the client.

RangeEnd       = The range value of the last record being sent to the client.
